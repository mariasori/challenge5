# Challenge 5

## Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This challenge required me to create a work day scheduler.  The scheduler displays the current date at the top.  It allows the user to add input into the time slots and save them to be uploaded in the future.  It also color codes the time slots based on whether the time slot is in the past, present, or future.
